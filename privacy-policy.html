    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="effective">Effective date: February 21, 2026</p>

    <p>Modern Tennis ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Modern Tennis mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, phone number, and the role you hold within your organization (owner, admin, coach, or parent).</p>
    <p><strong>Student Information:</strong> Parents and coaches may provide student names, dates of birth, and skill-level assessments to facilitate lesson scheduling and progress tracking.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect basic usage information such as login timestamps and feature interactions to maintain and improve the App.</p>
    <p><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect device type, operating system version, and a unique device identifier for push notifications and troubleshooting.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To create and manage your account</li>
      <li>To facilitate lesson scheduling, court assignments, and attendance tracking</li>
      <li>To enable communication between coaches, parents, and administrators</li>
      <li>To track student skill development and progress</li>
      <li>To send notifications about lessons, schedule changes, and account activity</li>
      <li>To maintain, improve, and secure the App</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored securely using <a href="https://supabase.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supabase</a>, a cloud-hosted database platform. Supabase encrypts data in transit (TLS) and at rest. We use row-level security policies to ensure users can only access data they are authorized to view.</p>
    <p>Authentication credentials are managed by Supabase Auth. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt and are never stored in plain text.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties. We may share data only in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Within your organization:</strong> Coaches, admins, and owners within the same tennis organization can view relevant student and scheduling data as needed to operate the program.</li>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> We use Supabase for data hosting and Expo Application Services (EAS) for app delivery. These providers process data on our behalf under their respective privacy policies.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, regulation, or legal process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the App's services. If you request account deletion, we will remove your personal data within 30 days, except where retention is required by law.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App stores information about student athletes, some of whom may be under 13. This data is provided and managed by parents or guardians and is used solely for lesson scheduling and skill tracking within the organization. We do not knowingly collect data directly from children under 13 without parental consent.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes through the App or via email. The "Effective date" at the top of this page indicates when the policy was last revised.</p>
